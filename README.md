# Real-Estate-Project
Goal: My goal in this project is to find all possible single family real estate investment oppurtunities in El Paso TX.
Method: I will begin by webscraping all rental and for sale listings in El Paso on realtor.com. Once I have all the data stored, I will use machine learning functions to predict the rent on a property. Once I have the rent estimate, I can run normal functions on calculating whether a property cashflows.
I used Python for the gist of this project except at the end I used SQL to display new variables in the dataset and to filter out all non-cashflow oppurtunities.
